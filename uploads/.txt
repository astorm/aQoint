Simple 2 column CSS layout

This is a tutorial on how to use CSS to create a simple two column layout.

The layout consists of a header, a horizontal navigation bar, a main content column, a sidebar, and a footer. It is also horizontally centered in the browser window. A pretty basic layout, and not at all difficult to create with CSS once you know how to deal with the inevitable Internet Explorer bugs.

1. Basic structure

First of all, we create the basic HTML structure:

   1. <div id="wrap">
	    2. <div id="header"></div>
			   3. <div id="nav"></div>
				    4. <div id="main"></div>
						   5. <div id="sidebar"></div>
							    6. <div id="footer"></div>
									   7. </div>

										 After that, we put some content in the different sections:

										    1. <div id="wrap">
												   2. <div id="header"><h1>Document Heading</h1></div>
													    3. <div id="nav">
															   4. <ul>
																    5. <li><a href="#">Option 1</a></li>
																		   6. <li><a href="#">Option 2</a></li>
																			    7. ...
																					   8. </ul>
																						    9. </div>
																								  10. <div id="main">
																									  11. <h2>Column 1</h2>
																										  12. <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit...</p>
																											  13. </div>
																												  14. <div id="sidebar">
																													  15. <h2>Column 2</h2>
																														  16. <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit...</p>
																															  17. <ul>
																																  18. <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
																																	  19. <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
																																		  20. ...
																																			  21. </ul>
																																				  22. </div>
																																					  23. <div id="footer">
																																						  24. <p>Footer</p>
																																							  25. </div>
																																								  26. </div>

																																									Now we have a completely unstyled HTML document which is structured in a way that lets us use CSS to control its layout.

																																									View step 1.
																																									2. Adjust the body and html elements

																																									To make the content reach the edges of the browser window, we set the margin and padding of the body and html elements to zero. We also specify colours for text and background.

																																									   1. body,
																																										    2. html {
																																												   3. margin:0;
																																													    4. padding:0;
																																															   5. color:#000;
																																																    6. background:#a7a09a;
																																																		   7. }

																																																			 View step 2.
																																																			 3. On to the main containers

																																																			 After that it’s time to give the content area a width and center it horizontally. We do that by specifying the width and margins of the main container, #wrap. We also give it a background colour to make it show up on the page.

																																																			 The method we use to center the content is based on the fact that when an element’s left and right margins are set to auto, they will share whatever is left when the element’s width has been subtracted from that of its container. In this case the width of #wrap will be subtracted from the width of the browser window.

																																																			 Note: for this method to work in Internet Explorer (version 6 and later only), the document must use a DOCTYPE that forces IE to use its standards mode. Please read Fix Your Site With the Right DOCTYPE! for more info.

																																																			    1. #wrap {
																																																					   2. width:750px;
																																																						    3. margin:0 auto;
																																																								   4. background:#99c;
																																																									    5. }

																																																											In case you’re wondering why we’re not using the body element to control the width and centering of the layout, it is because doing so can cause unwanted side-effects in some versions of Internet Explorer.

																																																											After that, we give the different sections of the document different background colours to make them show up.
